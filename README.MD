This is a test library for a job application

The idea is to create a Live footballworld cup score board as a library that can be used later in an application
I need to use TDD and thread safety as a main approach here. 

Plan for development goes as follows: 

1. setup and initialize a maven project
2. write interfaces
3. write test cases 
4. develop core functionality
5. enhance to be thread-safe and add extra test cases in case i see something is not covered
